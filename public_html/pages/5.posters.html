    <h1>Information for poster presenters</h1>

    <h3>
      Poster size
    </h3>
    <p>
      Please make sure your poster is at most DIN A0 size (that's 84.1 x 118.9 cm, or 33.1 x 46.8 inch). Smaller is fine
      too
      (bigger isn't always better - see the section on the Better Poster!). Poster can be either portrait or landscape.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Poster panel allocation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Each poster will have a numbered panel, which is the same as the abstract number you've been assigned. Conference
      volunteers will be on hand to help you with poster setup and the time for your session. If you submitted more than
      one
      poster, we will divide them over the sessions. If you want your posters to be grouped together in one session,
      please
      let us know by email at <a href="mailto:info@esrii2019.org">info@esrii2019.org</a>. Please ensure that you stand
      by your poster(s) during your session for
      discussion and questions. A poster is usually just the start of a great discussion!
      Poster session planning (including your abstract number) will be announced a month before the conference.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How to fix your poster to the poster board
    </h3>
    <p>
      The conference team will provide you with simple tacks/drawing pins to pin your poster to the poster board. Make
      sure
      you clean up any dropped pins - nobody likes to step on one.
    </p>

    <h3>
      General guidelines for posters
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A poster should be clear, self-contained and explanatory. When in doubt - keep the information simple. It's
        often better
        to put a little less on the poster than a little more - you'll be there to fill in the details and spark a
        conversation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to keep the cognitive load on the viewer as low as possible, so don't include too many complex graphs or
        large
        tables.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your poster reports on a (randomized) clinical trial, remember to include the trial registration number. If
        relevant,
        remember to include funding body registration numbers, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's always nice to bring smaller, printed versions of your poster so people can take a copy home. Same for
        calling
        cards with your name and contact details (most universities give them to you).
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, using a QR code on your poster is a great way to link to, e.g., a digital copy of the poster, your
        website, a published paper or pre-print, etc. You can make QR codes on this website: <a

      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>
      The Better Poster
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scientific posters are often seen as dull, boring, and ugly - and there's tens of them put together in a room. But
      scientific posters don't have to be huge walls of text and tables. The Better Poster attempts to increase the
      visibility, clarity (and beauty!) of your poster. If you're on Twitter, you can follow the #betterposter hashtag
      to see
      some fantastic examples of better posters. Some useful links about the Better Poster:

    <h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>
        Many printers now offer the option of printing your poster on canvas rather than paper. You can simply fold
        these and
        put them in your suitcase or bag - no need for those cumbersome poster tubes!
      </li>
      <li>
        Twitter is increasingly becoming a discussion platform during conferences. If you're on Twitter, make sure to
        include
        your Twitter handle on your poster and use the hashtag #esrii2019.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is information on your poster you don't want people to share publicly (for example, people sharing
        photos of
        your poster on Twitter or Facebook), please note this clearly on your poster.
      </li>
